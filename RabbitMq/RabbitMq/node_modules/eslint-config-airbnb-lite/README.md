# This is Deprecated.
As of eslint-config-airbnb v0.0.8, it starts to support config set without react:
```json
{
  "extends": "airbnb/base",
}
```

So this package is no longer needed.

# eslint-config-airbnb-lite
This package provides Airbnb's .eslintrc as an extensible shared config, but without react rules.

## Why

I like airbnb's javascript styleguide and eslint. Since eslint does not have presets included, we need to use 3rd party packages.

[eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) is a good one, but I don't need the react rules. This package removes the react related rules.

This package is still using babel-eslint, because eslint's native parser cannot support ES7 features well.

## Usage

1. `npm install eslint-config-airbnb-lite babel-eslint --save-dev`
2. add `"extends": "eslint-config-airbnb-lite"` to your .eslintrc
3. Override rules in .eslintrc

For example:
```json
{
  "extends": "eslint-config-airbnb-lite",
  "rules" : {
    "semi": [2, "never"],
  }
}
```

See [Airbnb's Javascript styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and
the [ESlint config docs](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files)
for more information.
